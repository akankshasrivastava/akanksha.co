From flicker to fire, with heedless fervour  
Toying with fate, their first autumn in Pilani  
They sparred and squabbled in playful skirmish  
Unmoored by the gentle rawness of Pilani  
She threaded tenderness into the skin of his back  
Suturing the rips in the quiet of Pilani  
He braided poetry into her wind kissed hair  
To the rhythm of the warbling bulbuls of Pilani  
They found faith in the yellowing Gulmohar leaves  
As hawkers cried hoarse in Nutan bazaars of Pilani  
Their hands embraced through rain and ruin  
Holding steady through the raging sandstorms of Pilani  
Carving promises* in sand, burying memories in water  
Rewriting the bittersweet farewells of Pilani.

*There let us meet one day, across unravelling distances,  
by the peeling grey paint, of a tattered old bench,  
On an unreturning January morning in Pilani

love  
Akanksha
